Date seems like a positional encoder.
Lets make 32k context length that means about 1.5 months into future. (2024-06-13 19:59:00 - 2024-05-15 04:00:00: 20k)
features (5*x: open, high, low, close, volume) and stock and mcap: gets also own vector also his sector and specific area. -> how to get closeness to sectors.


1. With long term data compute of the closeness of sectors (volatility/correlation coefficient)
2. Build a embedding around this 
3. Do this with Subsectors and specific stocks.
4. Build a transformer. (more like look for steps 4-10).
